# TSO – Positions

*A living document collecting concise position statements derived from the Time–Space Oscillation (TSO) perspective.*

This document is **not** a replacement for standard physical theories and **not** a collection of experimental claims. It records how TSO interprets, contextualizes, or reframes commonly marketed views in contemporary physics.

The guiding principles are:

* agreement with established empirical results,
* ontological restraint,
* emphasis on relational and oscillatory structure,
* avoidance of unnecessary metaphysical assumptions.

## 1. What is taken as fundamental?

**Marketed view:**
Quantum fields or particles are ontologically fundamental.

**TSO stance:**
TSO does not treat either fields or particles as primitive. The fundamental structure is *relational oscillation*. Fields and particles emerge as stable, coarse-grained descriptions of underlying oscillatory relations.

**Clarification:**
This stance does not deny the utility or correctness of field theories. It addresses ontology, not predictive formalism.

## 2. Are electrons point charges?

**Marketed view:**
Electrons have no spatial identity; only point charges and probability densities exist.

**TSO stance:**
TSO treats the electron as a persistent oscillatory identity. Its manifestation depends on spacetime compatibility: localized (ball-like) at rest, toroidal under motion, and wave-like when temporal self-closure is incompatible with measurement.

**Clarification:**
Wave-like detector images and apparent noise arise from relational projection induced by the measurement apparatus, not from the absence of particle identity.

---

## 3. Wave–particle duality

**Marketed view:**
Quantum objects are sometimes particles and sometimes waves.

**TSO stance:**
There is no duality of substance. A single oscillatory identity manifests differently depending on its compatibility with the spacetime evolution of the embedding system, in particular the synchronized oscillatory structure in which the measurement device resides.

## 4. Photons and proper time

**Marketed view:**
Photons are massless particles propagating through spacetime.

**TSO stance:**
Photons correspond to oscillatory relations that never achieve temporal self-closure. Their proper time is zero, and their wave-like nature reflects this incompatibility with rest-frame identity.

**Clarification:**
Temporal evolution attributed to photons arises relationally through interaction with detectors, not as an intrinsic property of the photon itself.

## 5. Fermions as the first stable identities

**Marketed view:**
All particles are excitations of fundamental fields.

**TSO stance:**
TSO treats fermions as the first dynamically stable spacetime-closed identities. Other particles exist, but lack long-term temporal self-closure and function as relational or transitional excitations.

**Clarification:**
This position is motivated by empirical stability (e.g. electron longevity) and does not deny the existence of bosons, scalar excitations, or other wave-like or helical patterns to which an identity can be consistently assigned.

## 6. Fermions, compositeness, and interaction-induced decomposition

**Marketed view:**
Hadrons are composed of elementary quarks and gluons as fundamental building blocks.

**TSO stance:**
In TSO, stable particles form elementary spacetime-closed oscillatory identities. What is described as “quark structure” emerges only under interactional probing and does not constitute an ontologically prior set of building blocks.

**Clarification:**

A stable particle corresponds to a unitary oscillational closure in spacetime. Its internal Fourier decomposition reproduces the same closed oscillatory structure. Only when an external interaction introduces additional oscillational modes does this closure decompose into relational components, which are then described as quarks and interaction carriers.

## 7. The Higgs boson

**Marketed view:**
The Higgs is a fundamental scalar particle with a fixed mass of ~125 GeV.

**TSO stance:**
In TSO, the Higgs corresponds to a minimally stable scalar oscillation that briefly exceeds coherence thresholds allowing partial spacetime localization. Its mass reflects the energy required to sustain this frustrated oscillatory configuration.

**Clarification:**
The Higgs is not denied, but is interpreted as a transient structural excitation rather than a primary identity.

---

## 8. Measurement and noise

**Marketed view:**
Observed noise reflects intrinsic quantum randomness.

**TSO stance:**
TSO interprets much observed noise and dithering as induced by spacetime incompatibility between the oscillatory identity and the measurement apparatus.

---

## 9. Mathematical structure and oscillation

**Marketed view:**
Oscillations are a feature of specific physical systems.

**TSO stance:**
Oscillation is a structural consequence of ordered series and their mathematical expression (e.g. natural number e, Euler’s formula). Physical models correspond to restricted views on this underlying oscillatory structure (e.g. different series partitionings).

**Clarification:**
Consistent models represent partial projections; their collective behavior converges back to global oscillatory dynamics.

---

## 10. Observation, measurement, and reality

**Marketed view:**
Physical reality, including wave-function collapse, forms upon observation, understood as a perceptual or cognitive event occurring in the brain.

**TSO stance:**
In TSO, reality as it is operationally defined does not form in the brain. Parameter concretion occurs at the physical interaction event between the measured entity and a TSO-bound apparatus (such as a measurement device), i.e. within a system of synchronized oscillators. Mental awareness is subsequent and does not constitute physical collapse.

**Clarification:**
TSO treats measurement as a relational physical process. Conscious perception registers outcomes but does not generate them.
