## Overview

TSO investigates:

- The intrinsic oscillatory behavior of particle relativistic time and space geometry.
- Effective TSO frequencies in composite or macroscopic systems.
- Connections between particle dynamics and gravitational effects.
- Relationships with quantum mechanics, quantum field theory (QFT) and classical relativistic frameworks.

The framework provides insights into particle interactions, spacetime structure, and potentially unifying aspects of fundamental forces.
