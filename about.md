# About Time–Space Oscillations (TSO)

Time–Space Oscillations (TSO) is a proposed theoretical framework
that explores the intrinsic temporal/spatial dynamics of particles and spacetime,
connecting relativistic and quantum phenomena.

It investigates how oscillatory structures underlie physical processes and
offers a geometric viewpoint on foundational concepts in physics.

A short explanation wiki about the fundamentals of TSO can be found here: https://github.com/ndl1971/time-space-oscillations/wiki 

This repository acts as a central index of publications related to TSO.
