## Conceptual Foundations of TSO

### 1. Time–Space Oscillations – Introduction Papers  
**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.17671564  

Central hub linking foundational TSO articles. Overview of the deterministic,
geometric approach to quantum mechanics, relativity, entanglement, and spacetime
oscillations.  
This reference serves solely as an entry point for the introduction papers
outlined in this section.

**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.17534735  

Introduces particles as fundamental oscillators with intertwined temporal and
spatial components, unifying relativistic effects, matter–antimatter symmetry,
and the emergence of forces via temporal and spatial frequency gradients.

---

### 3. Time Dilation and the Nature of Gravitational and Inertial Forces  
**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.17543060  

Shows how gravitational and inertial forces arise naturally from temporal
gradients, bridging Newtonian mechanics, relativity, and intrinsic TSO
oscillations.

### 4. Time–Space Oscillations and Electromagnetics  
**DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.17591325  

Extends TSO to classical electromagnetism, demonstrating that voltage, current,
impedance, and wave propagation emerge from time–space oscillations rather than
being independent oscillatory entities.
